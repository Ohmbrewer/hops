there are a number of library files and actual libraries 
used in this file, which are currently not uploaded.  
if a binary file is present in this folder, that file
should contain all neccesary code to properly flash a 
device however. 

rhizome.ino is under development and has limited functionality
at the moment. a note will be made once the package is finished
